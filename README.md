# Introduction

In this repository Michelle (masterwayz) knowledge dumps all she knows about things that relops/release sre does.
Think of things like how to troubleshoot GCP workers, how to create GCP images for builders and testers. Things like that.

This repository is cloned from https://gitlab.masterwayz.nl/mgoossens/moz-relops-docs
The GitHub mirror can be used for outside work for now while I build out things, michelle has a button to merge GitHub back to GitLab to keep things in sync.
The cloning from GitLab to GitHub is automated.
